# Art Quiz App

This is an art quiz app where the user can test their knowledge of artworks and their corresponding artist. The user is presented with an image immediately on page load and can choose between four artist's names. If the correct answer is selected the tally at the bottom of the page will increase by 1 and the next image will be shown. If the incorrect answer is selected, the correct answer will be shown in green and then the next image will be shown. When the user has seen ten images, they will be presented with their total correct score and the option to take the quiz again.
