# Art Quiz App

## The Purpose of the Project

This is an art quiz app intended to test the user's knowlegde of Great Women Artists and their artworks. This quiz was inspired by the recently published 'The Story of Art Without Men' by Katy Hassel, and hopes to promote an interest in the user to further explore the works of Great Women Artists throughout history and today.

### User Stories

- Home Page - As a visiting user, I want to be able to start the quiz immediately without having to introduce my name or age. I want to see the correct or incorrect answer after making my selection and I want to see my score recorded.

- End Section - As a visiting user, I want to see my final result after completing the quiz and have the option to take the quiz again.

- About Page - As a visiting user, I want to learn more about the quiz and find a link to further information about Great Women Artists.

### Features

- The user is presented with an image immediately on page load and can choose between four artist's names. If the correct answer is selected the tally at the bottom of the page will increase by 1 and the next image will be shown. If the incorrect answer is selected, the correct answer will be shown in green and then the next image will be shown. When the user has seen ten images, they will be presented with their total correct score and the option to take the quiz again.
